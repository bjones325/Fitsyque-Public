# Fitsyque
Fitsyque is a fitness app which encourages individuals to focus on strength, measurements, and body composition. After creating an account, users can record workouts, macronutrients, and body measurements alongside photos of their physique. Users can then view graphs to track their progress over time.

The app stack consists of a React-Native client (optimized for iOS), a Node.js REST API, and a MySQL database. Both Node.js and MySQL are hosted via Microsoft Azure's App Service.

Rest API Files can be found under the "Node.js Files" directory and the Entity Relationship diagram describing the MySQL schema is listed as "MySQL ER Diagram.png" under root.
